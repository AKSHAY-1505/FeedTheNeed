need of food resources with nearby restaurants. The platform aims to create a
seamless and efficient system for the redistribution of excess food, fostering
collaboration between these entities.

and other groups in need, the project aims to significantly reduce food wastage.
This objective addresses the environmental and ethical concerns associated with
the unnecessary disposal of edible food.

**Alleviate Hunger**

ensuring that excess food resources from restaurants reach those who are in need
of sustenance. By providing timely access to food, "Feed The Need" aims to
contribute to the alleviation of hunger and improve the overall food security of
vulnerable populations.

**Secure Login Model**

The project implements a secure login model to establish
trust and confidentiality between restaurants and charities. The objective is to
create a safe and reliable platform for communication and coordination, ensuring
that the donation process is streamlined and transparent.

**Foster Collaboration**

community engagement between restaurants, charities, and groups dedicated to
addressing hunger. By creating a shared platform, the project seeks to encourage
collective action and a sense of social responsibility in tackling the issue of food
insecurity.
